NAME
----
git-task - an issue tracker for git repositories

SYNOPSIS
--------
git-task [<task-warrior command>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This little script adds an issue tracker to any git repository, backed by 
Taskwarrior, the command line todo manager. For this, it creates a new branch 
called 'git-task', on which it automatically commits all tasks you create, 
change, or delete.

Take note that this is not a (good) replacement for a full-featured bug/issue 
tracker, like trac or bugzilla. It's meant for small, mostly one-person projects 
for which such a full-featured tracker would be overkill. It's also a neat way 
to share a simple todo list with multiple people.

To use this as a pseudo git-command, you can add an alias in your .gitconfig:

	task = !path/to/git-task.sh

Now also supports worktrees. Parses the output of 'git worktree list
--porcelaine' to check whether the task branch has a worktree and, if so,
simply 'cd's there instead of the whole stach behavior. You could for example
create a directory directly in you git root and add it to '.gitignore'. Then
add run 'git worktree add path/to/tasks/directory <task branch>'.
