NAME
----
git-task - an issue tracker for git repositories


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This little script adds an issue tracker to any git repository, backed by 
Taskwarrior, the command line todo manager. For this, it creates a new branch 
called 'git-task', on which it automatically commits all tasks you create, 
change, or delete.

Take note that this is not a (good) replacement for a full-featured bug/issue 
tracker, like trac or bugzilla. It's meant for small, mostly one-person projects 
for which such a full-featured tracker would be overkill. It's also a neat way 
to share a simple todo list with multiple people.

To use this as a pseudo git-command, you can add an alias in your .gitconfig:

	task = !path/to/git-task.sh
